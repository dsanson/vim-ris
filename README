vim-ris README
==============

vim-ris provides a vim plugin and syntax for RIS file editing.

Dbn was written for a Debian Sarge/testing system.  It will likely work without problem on other unices.  I suspect it will require significant debugging/rewriting for Windows use.

See the installed help after installation.
